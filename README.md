# Machine Learning Project
By Leonardo Mirandola

## Introduction

This project is part of a machine learning university course. The aim was to develop a machine learning model.


## Usage

A Conda environment file is located in the data folder with all the necessary packages installed, you'll only need to download the [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gene+expression+cancer+RNA-Seq) and decompress the data.csv and labels.csv in the data folder if you want to run it locally. 
Otherwise, the same environment and notebook can be launched via Google [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xIF1pVly9OxCLjmNYrYbNXQQi7juAdHK).

To launch the program open it with Jupyter notebook and select the notebook.
Then either look at the results or launch the run all command.

## Information

### Neural Network
A neural network was developed and optimized by grid search with cross-validation.

### Decision Tree (Gradient Boosting)
A gradient boosting model was created also with grid search and cross-validation.

Optimization of both models hyperparameters and speed were taken into account with multiprocessing and threading.
